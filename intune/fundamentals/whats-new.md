## Week of December 2, 2019

#### New System Center Configuration Manager Co-Management Licensing<!--5027281-->
A new license is now available that lets System Center Configuration Manager customers with Software Assurance get Intune PC management rights without having to purchase an additional Intune license for co-management. Customers no longer need to assign individual Intune/EMS licenses to their end users.
- Devices managed by System Center Configuration Manager and enrolled into co-management have almost the same rights as an Intune Standalone managed PC. However, after resetting they can't be re-provisioned by using Autopilot.
- Windows 10 devices enrolled into Intune by using other means require full Intune licenses.
- Devices on other platforms still require full Intune licenses.

## Week of November 18, 2019 (1911 Service release)

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### App management

#### S/MIME support with Microsoft Outlook for iOS<!-- 2669398 idready -->
Intune supports delivering S/MIME signing and encryption certificates that can be used with Outlook for iOS on iOS devices. For more information, see [Configure S/MIME for Outlook for iOS](~/apps/app-configuration-policies-outlook-smime.md).

#### UI update when selectively wiping app data<!-- 4102028 -->
The UI to selectively wipe app data in Intune has been updated. UI changes include:
- A simplified experience by using a wizard-style format condensed within one pane.
- An update to the create flow to include assignments.
- A summarized page of all things set when viewing properties, prior to creating a new policy or when editing a property. Also, when editing properties, the summary will only show a list of items from the category of properties being edited.

For more information, see [How to wipe only corporate data from Intune-managed apps](~/apps/apps-selective-wipe.md).

#### iOS and iPadOS third party keyboard support<!-- 4922950 -->
In March, 2019, we announced the removal of support for the iOS App protection policy setting "Third party keyboards". The feature is returning to Intune with both iOS and iPadOS support. To enable this setting, visit the **Data protection** tab of a new or existing iOS/iPadOS app protection policy and find the **Third party keyboards** setting under **Data Transfer**.

The behavior of this policy setting differs slightly from the previous implementation. In multi-identity apps using SDK version 12.0.16 and later, targeted by app protection policies with this setting configured to **Block**, end-users will be unable to opt for third party keyboards in both their organization and personal accounts. Apps using SDK versions 12.0.12 and earlier will continue to exhibit the behavior documented in our blog post title, [Known issue: Third party keyboards are not blocked in iOS for personal accounts](https://aka.ms/3rdparty_iOS_Intune).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device configuration

#### Target macOS user groups to require Jamf management<!-- 4061739  --> 
You can target specific groups of users that will get their [macOS devices managed by Jamf](../protect/conditional-access-integrate-jamf.md). This enables you apply the Jamf compliance integration to a subset of macOS devices while other devices are managed by Intune. If you are already using the Jamf integration, All Users will be targeted for the integration by default.

#### New Exchange ActiveSync settings when creating an Email device configuration profile on iOS devices<!-- 4892824   --> 
On iOS/iPadOS devices, you can configure email connectivity in a device configuration profile (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Email** for profile type). 

There are new Exchange ActiveSync settings available, including:
- **Exchange data to sync**: Choose the Exchange services to sync (or block syncing) for Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, Notes, and Email.
- **Allow users to change sync settings**: Allow (or block) users to change the sync settings for these services on their devices.  

For more information on these setting, go to [Email profile settings for iOS devices in Intune](../configuration/email-settings-ios.md). 

Applies to:
- iOS 13.0 and newer
- iPadOS 13.0 and newer

#### Prevent users from adding personal Google accounts to Android Enterprise fully managed and dedicated devices<!-- 5353228   -->
On Android Enterprise fully managed and dedicated devices, there's a new setting that prevent users from creating personal Google accounts (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Device Owner Only > Device Restrictions** for profile type > **Users and Accounts settings** > **Personal Google Accounts**).

To see the settings you can configure, go to [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md).

Applies to:
- Android Enterprise fully managed devices
- Android Enterprise dedicated devices

#### Server-side logging for Siri commands setting is removed in iOS/iPadOS device restrictions profile <!-- 5468501   -->
On iOS and iPadOS devices, the **Server-side logging for Siri commands** setting is removed from the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin console (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile type > **Built-in apps**). 

This setting has no effect on devices. To remove the setting from existing profiles, open the profile, make any change, and then save the profile. The profile is updated, and the setting is deleted from devices.

To see all the settings you can configure, see [iOS and iPadOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md).

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS

#### Windows 10 feature updates (public preview)<!-- 2384877 -->
You can now deploy [Windows 10 feature updates](../protect/windows-update-for-business-configure.md#windows-10-feature-updates) to Windows 10 devices. Windows 10 feature updates are a new software update policy that sets the version of Windows 10 that you want devices to install and remain at. You can use this new policy type along with your existing Windows 10 update rings.

Devices that receive Windows 10 feature updates policy will install the specified version of Windows, and then remain at that version until the policy is edited or removed. Devices that run a later version of Windows remain at their current version. Devices that are held at a specific version of Windows can still install quality and security updates for that version from Windows 10 update rings.

This new type of policy begins rolling out to tenants this week. If this policy isn't available for your tenant yet, it will be soon.

#### Add and change key information in plist files for macOS applications<!-- 4736278 -->
On macOS devices, you can now create a device configuration profile that uploads a property list file (.plist) associated with an app or with the device (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **macOS** for platform > **Preference File** for profile type).

Only some apps support managed preferences, and these apps might not allow you to manage all settings. Be sure to upload a property list file that configures device channel settings, not user channel settings.

For more information on this feature, see [Add a property list file to macOS devices using Microsoft Intune](../configuration/preference-file-settings-macos.md).

Applies to:
- macOS devices running 10.7 and newer

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device management

#### Edit device name value for Autopilot devices<!-- 2640074 -->
You can edit the Device Name value for Azure AD Joined Autopilot devices.  For more information, see [Edit Autopilot device attributes](../enrollment/enrollment-autopilot.md#edit-autopilot-device-attributes).

#### Edit Group Tag value for Autopilot devices<!-- 4816775   -->
You can edit the Group Tag value for Autopilot devices. For more information, see [Edit Autopilot device attributes](../enrollment/enrollment-autopilot.md#edit-autopilot-device-attributes).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Updated support experience<!-- 5012398 -->

Starting today, an updated and streamlined in-console experience for [getting help and support for Intune](get-support.md) is rolling out to tenants. If this new experience isn't available for you yet, it will be soon.

We've improved the in-console search and feedback for common issues, and the workflow you use to contact support. When opening a support issue, you'll see real-time estimates for when you can expect a callback or email reply, and Premier and Unified support customers can easily specify a severity for their issue, to help get support faster.

#### Improved Intune reporting experience (public preview) <!-- 3791418 -->
Intune now provides an improved reporting experience, including new report types, better report organization, more focused views, improved report functionality, as well as more consistent and timely data. New report types focus on the following:
- **Operational** - Provides fresh records with a negative health focus. 
- **Organizational** - Provides an broader summary of the overall state.
- **Historical** - Provides patterns and trends over a period of time.
- **Specialist** - Allows you to use raw data to create your own custom reports.

The first set of new reports focuses on device compliance. For more information, see [Blog - Microsoft Intune reporting framework](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/New-Reporting-Framework-Coming-to-Intune/ba-p/1009553) and [Intune reports](~/fundamentals/reports.md).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Role-based access control

#### Duplicate custom or built-in roles <!-- 1081938   -->
You can now copy built-in and custom roles. For more information, see [Copy a role](../fundamentals/create-custom-role.md#copy-a-role).

#### New permissions for school administrator role <!-- 5621805  -->  
Two new permissions, **Assign profile** and **Sync device**, have been added to the school administrator role > **Permissions** > **Enrollment programs**. The sync profile permission lets group admins sync Windows Autopilot devices. The assign profile permission lets them delete user-initiated Apple enrollment profiles. It also gives them permission to manage Autopilot device assignments and Autopilot deployment profile assignments. For a list of all school administrator/group admin permissions, see [Assign group admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-education/group-admin-delegate). 

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Security

#### BitLocker key rotation<!-- 2564951  -->
You can use an Intune device action to remotely [rotate BitLocker recovery keys](../protect/encrypt-devices.md#rotate-bitlocker-recovery-keys)  for managed devices that run Windows version 1909 or later. To qualify to have recovery keys rotated, devices must be configured to support recovery key rotation.  

#### Updates to dedicated device enrollment to support SCEP device certificate deployment <!-- 5198878  -->
Intune now supports SCEP device certificate deployment to Android Enterprise dedicated devices for certificate-based access to Wi-Fi profiles. The Microsoft Intune app must be present on the device for deployment to work. As a result, we've updated the enrollment experience for Android Enterprise dedicated devices. New enrollments still start the same (with QR, NFC, Zero-touch, or device identifier) but now have a step that requires users to install the Intune app. Existing devices will start getting the app automatically installed on a rolling basis.

#### Intune audit logs for business-to-business collaboration<!--5670211 -->
Business-to-business (B2B) collaboration allows you to securely share you company's applications and services with guest users from any other organization, while maintaining control over your own corporate data. Intune now supports audit logs for B2B guest users. For example, when guest users make changes, Intune will be able to capture this data through audit logs. For more information, see [What is guest user access in Azure Active Directory B2B?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/what-is-b2b)

For more information about Web apps, see [Add web apps to Microsoft Intune](~/apps/web-app.md).  


#### New assignment type column in Company Portal for Windows 10 <!-- 5459950 WNready -->
The Company Portal > **Installed Apps** > **Assignment type** column has been renamed to **Required by your organization**.  Under that column, users will see a **Yes** or **No** value to indicate that an app is either required or made optional by their organization. These changes were made because device users were confused about the concept of available apps. Your users can find more information about installing apps from Company Portal in [Install and share apps on your device](/intune-user-help/install-apps-cpapp-windows). For more  information about configuring the Company Portal app for your users, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](~/apps/company-portal-app.md).

## Week of October 28, 2019

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### App management

#### Improved checklist design in Company Portal app for Android<!-- 5550857 -->  
The setup checklist in the Company Portal app for Android has been updated with a lightweight design and new icons. The changes align with the recent updates made to the Company Portal app for iOS. For a side-by-side comparison of the changes, see [What's new in the app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md). For a look at the updated enrollment steps, see [Enroll with Android work profile](/intune-user-help/enroll-device-android-work-profile) and [Enroll your Android device](/intune-user-help/enroll-device-android-company-portal).  

#### Win32 apps on Windows 10 S mode devices<!-- 3747604 --> 
You can install and run Win32 apps on Windows 10 S mode managed devices. To do this, you can create one or more supplemental policies for S mode using the Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) PowerShell tools. Sign the supplemental policies with the Device Guard Signing Portal and then upload and distribute the policies via Intune. In Intune, you will find this capability by selecting **Client apps** > **Windows 10 S supplemental policies**. For more information, see [Enable Win32 apps on S mode devices](~/apps/apps-win32-s-mode.md).

#### Set Win32 app availability based on a date and time<!-- 3510685 -->
As an admin, you can configure the start time and deadline time for a required Win32 app. At the start time, Intune management extension will start the app content download and cache it. The app will be installed at the deadline time. For available apps, start time will dictate when the app is visible in Company Portal. For more information, see [Intune Win32 app management](~/apps/apps-win32-app-management.md#set-win32-app-availability-and-notifications).

#### Require device restart based on grace period after Win32 app install<!-- 3136567 -->
You can require that a device must restart after a Win32 app successfully installs. For more information, see [Win32 app management - Configure app installation details](~/apps/apps-win32-app-management.md#step-4-configure-app-installation-details).

#### Dark Mode for iOS Company Portal<!-- 4911422 -->
Dark Mode is available for the iOS Company Portal. Users can download company apps, manage their devices, and get IT support in the color scheme of their choice based on device settings. The iOS Company Portal will automatically match the end user's device settings for dark or light mode. For more information, see [Introducing dark mode on Microsoft Intune Company Portal for iOS](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Enterprise-Mobility-Security/Introducing-dark-mode-on-Microsoft-Intune-Company-Portal-for-iOS/ba-p/918453). For more information about the iOS Company Portal, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](~/apps/company-portal-app.md).

#### Android Company Portal enforced minimum app version<!-- 2378776 -->
By using the **Min Company Portal version** setting of an app protection policy, you can specify a specific minimum defined version of the Company Portal that is enforced on an end user device. This conditional launch setting allows you to **Block access**, **Wipe data**, or **Warn** as possible actions when the value is not met. The possible formats for this value follows the pattern *[Major].[Minor]*, *[Major].[Minor].[Build]*, or *[Major].[Minor].[Build].[Revision]*.

The **Min Company Portal version** setting, if configured, will affect any end user who gets version 5.0.4560.0 of the Company Portal and any future versions of the Company Portal. This setting will have no effect on users using a version of Company Portal that is older than the version that this feature is released with. End users using app auto-updates on their device will likely not see any dialogs from this feature, given that they will likely be on the latest Company Portal version. This setting is Android only with app protection for enrolled and unenrolled devices. For more information, see [Android app protection policy settings - Conditional launch](~/apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#conditional-launch).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->

- The revised workflow includes Assignments, before completing the initial configuration of the ring.
- A summary page you can use to review all the configurations you made, before saving and deploying a new update ring. When editing an update ring, the summary shows only the list of items set within the category of properties you edited.

#### UI update for creating and editing iOS software update policy<!-- 4099090       --> 
We’ve updated the UI experience for [creating](../protect/software-updates-ios.md#configure-the-policy) and [editing](../protect/software-updates-ios.md#edit-a-policy) iOS software update policies for Intune.  Changes to UI include:  
- A wizard-style format condensed into a single console blade, which does away with the blade sprawl seen previously as you configure update policies.   
- The revised workflow includes Assignments, before completing the initial configuration of the policy.
- A summary page you can use to review all the configurations you made, before saving and deploying a new policy. When editing a policy, the summary shows only the list of items set within the category of properties you edited.

#### Engaged restart settings are removed from Windows Update rings<!--  4464404   WNReady   -->
As previously announced, Intune's Windows 10 Update rings now [support settings for deadlines](../protect/windows-update-settings.md) and no longer support *Engaged restart*. Settings for *Engaged restart* are no longer available when you configure or manage Update rings in Intune.  

This change aligns with recent [Windows servicing changes](https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-1903#servicing) and on devices that run Windows 10 1903 or later, *deadlines* supersede configurations for *engaged restart*.

#### Prevent installation of apps from Unknown Sources on Android Enterprise work profile devices<!-- 4760025   -->
On Android Enterprise work profile devices, users can't ever install apps apps from unknown sources.

### Device security

#### PKCS certificates for macOS<!-- 1333650       -->
You can now [use PKCS certificates with macOS](../protect/certficates-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-certificate-profile). You can select the PKCS certificate as a profile type for macOS, and deploy user and device certificates that have [customized subject and subject alternative name fields](../protect/certficates-pfx-configure.md#subject-name-format-for-macos).  

PKCS certificate for macOS also support a new setting, _Allow All Apps Access_. With this setting you can enable all associated apps access to the private key of the certificate.  For more information about this setting, see the Apple documentation at https://developer.apple.com/business/documentation/Configuration-Profile-Reference.pdf.

####   Derived Credentials to provision iOS mobile devices with certificates<!--  1736036, 1736037, 1772050, 2777333         -->  
Intune supports use of [derived credentials](../protect/derived-credentials.md) as an authentication method and for S/MIME signing and encryption for iOS devices. Derived credentials are an implementation of the *National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-157* standard for deploying certificates to devices.  

Derived credentials rely on the use of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or Common Access Card (CAC) card, like a smart card. To get a derived credential for their mobile device, users start in the Company Portal app and follow an enrollment workflow that is unique to the provider you use.  Common to all providers is the requirement to use a smart card on a computer to authenticate to the derived credential provider. That provider then issues a certificate to the device that's derived from the user’s smart card.  

Intune supports the following derived credential providers:
- DISA Purebred
- Entrust Datacard
- Intercede

You use derived credentials as the authentication method for device configuration profiles for VPN, Wi-Fi, and email. You can also use them for app authentication, and S/MIME signing and encryption.  

For more information about the standard, see [Derived PIV Credentials](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/piv-credentials) at www.nccoe.nist.gov.

#### Use Graph API to specify a on-premises User Principal Name as a variable for SCEP certificates<!--  5437939        -->  
When you use the [Intune Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/intune-graph-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0), you can specify onPremisesUserPrincipalName as a variable for the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for SCEP certificates.

### App management 

#### Managed Google Play private LOB apps<!-- 1464182  -->
Intune now allows IT admins to publish private Android LOB apps to Managed Google Play via an iframe embedded in the Intune console.  Previously, IT admins needed to publish LOB apps directly to Google's Play publishing console, which required several steps and was time consuming. This new feature allows for easy publishing of LOB apps with a minimal set of steps, without needing to leave the Intune console.  Admins will no longer need to manually register as a developer with Google, and will no longer need to pay the Google $25 registration fee.  Any of the Android Enterprise management scenarios that use Managed Google Play can take advantage of this feature (work profile, dedicated, fully managed, and non-enrolled devices). From Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps** > **Add**. Then, select **Managed Google Play** from the **App type** list. For more information about Managed Google Play apps, see [Add Managed Google Play apps to Android Enterprise devices with Intune](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md).

#### Windows Company Portal experience<!-- 1473353, 3598357 -->
The Windows Company Portal is being updated. You will be able to use multiple filters on the Apps page within the Windows Company Portal. The Device Details page is also being updated with an improved user experience. We are in the process of rolling out these updates to all customers and expect to be completed by the end of next week.

#### macOS support for web apps<!-- 3174427 -->
Web apps, which allow you to add a shortcut to a URL on the web, can be installed to the Dock using the macOS Company Portal. End users can access the **Install** action from the app details page for a web app in the macOS Company Portal. For more information about the **Web link** app type, see [Add apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-add.md) and [Add web apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/web-app.md).

#### macOS support for VPP apps<!-- 3173501  -->
macOS apps, purchased using Apple Business Manager, are displayed in the console when Apple VPP tokens are synced in Intune. You can assign, revoke and reassign device and user-based licenses for groups using the Intune console. Microsoft Intune helps you manage VPP apps purchased for use at your company by:

- Reporting license information from the app store.
- Tracking how many of the licenses you have used.
- Helping you prevent installation of more copies of the app than you own.

For more information about Intune and VPP, see [Manage volume-purchased apps and books with Microsoft Intune](../apps/vpp-apps.md).

#### Managed Google Play iframe support<!-- 2871756  -->
Intune now provides support for adding and managing web links directly in the  Intune console via the Managed Google Play iframe.  This lets IT admins submit a URL and icon graphic, and then deploy those links to devices just like regular Android apps. Any of the Android Enterprise management scenarios that use Managed Google Play can take advantage of this feature (work profile, dedicated, fully managed, and non-enrolled devices). From Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps** > **Add**. Then, select **Managed Google Play** from the **App type** list. For more information about Managed Google Play apps, see [Add Managed Google Play apps to Android Enterprise devices with Intune](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md).

#### Silently install Android LOB apps on Zebra devices<!-- 4252734  -->
When installing Android line-of-business (LOB) apps on [Zebra devices](../configuration/android-zebra-mx-overview.md), rather than being prompted to both download and install the LOB app, you will be able to install the app silently. In Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps** > **Add**. In the **Add app** pane, select **Line-of-business app**. For more information, see [Add an Android line-of-business app to Microsoft Intune](../apps/lob-apps-android.md).

Currently, after the LOB app is downloaded, a **download success** notification will appear on the user's device. The notification can only be dismissed by tapping **Clear All** in the notification shade. This notification issue will be fixed in an upcoming release, and the installation will be completely silent with no visual indicators.

#### Read and write Graph API operations for Intune apps<!-- 5031704  -->
Applications can call the Intune Graph API with both read and write operations using app identity without user credentials. For more information about accessing the Microsoft Graph API for Intune, see [Working with Intune in Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/intune-graph-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0).

#### Deadlines replace Engaged restart settings for Windows Update rings<!-- 4464404        -->
To align with recent [Windows servicing changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-1903#servicing), Intune's Windows 10 Update rings now [support settings for deadlines](../protect/windows-update-settings.md). *Deadlines* determine when a device installs feature and security updates.  On devices that run Windows 10 1903 or later, *deadlines* supersede configurations for *engaged restart*.  In the future, *deadlines* will supersede *engaged restart* on earlier versions of Windows 10 as well.  

When you don’t’ configure *deadlines*, devices continue to use their *engaged restart* settings, however Intune will deprecate support for engaged restart settings in a future update.  

Plan to use *deadlines* for all your Windows 10 devices. After settings for *deadlines* are in place, you can change your Intune configurations for *engaged restart* to be Not configured. When set to Not configured, Intune stops managing those settings on devices but doesn’t remove the last configurations for the setting from the device. Therefore, the last configurations that were set for *engaged restart* remain active and in use on devices until those settings are modified by a method other than Intune. Later, when the devices version of Windows changes or when Intune support for *deadlines* expands to the devices Windows version, the device will begin to use the new settings, which are already in place.

#### Support for multiple Microsoft Intune Certificate Connectors<!--   4704642      -->
Intune now supports install and use of multiple [Microsoft Intune Certificate Connectors for PKCS operations](../protect/certficates-pfx-configure.md). This change supports load balancing and high availability of the connector. Each connector instance can process certificate requests from Intune.  If one connector is unavailable, other connectors continue to process requests.

To use multiple connectors, you don’t need to upgrade to the latest version of the connector software.  

#### New settings, and changes to existing settings to restrict features on iOS and macOS devices<!-- 4867699 4867709   -->
You can create profiles to restrict settings on devices running iOS and macOS (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS** or **macOS** for platform type > **Device restrictions**). This update includes the following features:

#### Handling pre-configuration of corporate device identifiers for Android Q devices<!-- 4711509  idmiss -->
In Android Q (v10), Google will remove the ability for MDM agents on legacy-managed (device administrator) Android devices to collect device identifier information.  Intune has a feature that enables IT admins to [pre-configure a list of device serial numbers or IMEIs](../enrollment/corporate-identifiers-add.md#identify-corporate-owned-devices-with-imei-or-serial-number) in order to automatically tag these devices as corporate-owned. This feature won't work for Android Q devices that are device admin-managed.  Regardless of whether the serial number or IMEI for the device is uploaded, it will always be considered to be personal during Intune enrollment.  You can manually switch ownership to corporate after enrollment.  This affects new enrollments only, and existing enrolled devices are not affected.  Android devices managed with work profiles are not affected by this change and will continue working as they do today.  Additionally, Android Q devices enrolled as device administrator will no longer be able to report serial number or IMEI in the Intune console as device properties.

#### Icons have changed for Android Enterprise enrollments (work profile, dedicated devices, and fully managed devices)<!-- 4977730 -->
The icons for Android Enterprise enrollment profiles have changed. To see the new icons, go to **Intune** > **Enrollment** > **Android enrollment** > look under **Enrollment profiles**.

When you create or edit [Security Baseline profiles](../protect/security-baselines.md#create-the-profile), you can specify keywords in the new *Search* bar to filter the available groups of settings to those that contain your search criteria.

#### The Security Baselines feature is now generally available<!-- 3785395 -->
The **Security Baselines** feature is out of preview and is now generally available (GA).  This means the feature is ready for use in production. However, the individual baseline templates can remain in preview and are evaluated and released to GA on their own schedules.

#### The MDM Security Baseline template is now generally available<!-- 3794072, 4217151,  3534649 -->
The MDM Security Baseline template has moved out of preview and is now generally available (GA). The GA template is identified as **MDM Security Baseline for May 2019**.  This is a new template and not an upgrade from the preview version.  As a new template, you’ll need to review the [settings it contains](../protect/security-baseline-settings-mdm.md), and then create new profiles to deploy the template to your device. Other security baseline templates can remain in preview. For a list of available baselines, see [Available security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md#available-security-baselines).  

In addition to being a new template, the *MDM Security Baseline for May 2019* template includes the two settings that we recently announced in our In Development article:  
- Above Lock: Voice activate apps from a locked screen  
- DeviceGuard: Use virtualization-based security (VBS) at the next reboot of devices.  

The *MDM Security Baseline for May 2019* also includes the addition of several new settings, the removal of others, and a revision of the default value of one setting. For a detailed list of the changes from Preview to GA, see **What’s changed in the new template**.

#### Security baseline versioning<!-- 3194322 -->
Security baselines for Intune support versioning. With this support, as new versions of each security baseline are released, you can update your existing security baseline profiles to use the newer baseline version without having to recreate and deploy a new baseline from scratch. Additionally, in the Intune console you can view information about each baseline like the number of individual profiles you have that use the baseline, how many of the different baseline versions your profiles use, and when the latest release of a specific security baseline was.  For more information, see **Security Baselines**.

#### The Use security keys for sign-in setting has moved<!-- 4501151 -->
The device configuration setting for identity protection named **Use security keys for sign-in** is no longer found as a sub-setting of *Configure Windows Hello for Business*. It's now a top-level setting that is always available, even when you don't enable use of Windows Hello for Business. For more information, see [Identity protection](../protect/identity-protection-windows-settings.md).

### Role-based access control

#### New permissions for assigned group admins<!-- 4504437   -->
Intune's built-in School Administrator role now has create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) permissions for Managed Apps. This update means that if you're assigned as a group admin in Intune for Education, you can now create, view, update, and delete the iOS MDM Push Certificate, iOS MDM server tokens, and iOS VPP tokens along with [all of the existing permissions you have](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-education/group-admin-delegate#group-admin-permissions). To take any of these actions, go to **Tenant settings** > **iOS Device Management**.  

#### Applications can use the Graph API to call read operations without user credentials<!-- 4655885 -->
Applications can call Intune Graph API read operations with app identity without user credentials. For more information about accessing the Microsoft Graph API for Intune, see [Working with Intune in Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/intune-graph-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0).

#### Apply scope tags to Microsoft Store for Business apps<!-- 4392555 -->
You can now apply scope tags to Microsoft Store for Business apps. For more information about scope tags, see [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT](scope-tags.md).

## Week of May 20, 2019

### App management

#### Windows Company Portal app<!-- 3316993 -->
The Windows Company Portal app will now have a new page labeled **Devices**. The **Devices** page will show end users all of their enrolled devices. Users will see this change in the Company Portal when they use version 10.3.4291.0 and later. For information about the configuring the Company Portal, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Autopilot device OrderID attribute name changed to Group Tag <!-- 4659453 -->

To make it more intuitive, the **OrderID** attribute name on Autopilot devices has been changed to **Group Tag**. When using CSVs to upload Autopilot device information, you must use Group Tag as the column header, not OrderID.  

## Week of May 13, 2019 (1905 Service release)

### App management

#### Intune policies update authentication method and Company Portal app installation<!-- 1927359  -->
On devices already enrolled via Setup Assistant through one of Apple’s corporate device enrollment methods, Intune will no longer support the Company Portal when it is manually installed by end users from the app store. This change is only relevant when you authenticate with Apple Setup Assistant during enrollment. This change also only affects iOS devices enrolled through:  
* Apple configurator

* Apple Business Manager

* Apple School Manager

* Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP)

If users install the Company Portal app from the App store, and then try to enroll these devices through it, they will receive an error. These devices will be expected to only use the Company Portal when it's been pushed, automatically, by Intune during enrollment. Enrollment profiles in Intune in the Azure portal will be updated so that you can specify how devices authenticate and if they receive the Company Portal app. If you want your DEP device users to have the Company Portal, you will need to specify your preferences in an enrollment profile. 

In addition, the **Identify your device** screen in the iOS Company Portal is being removed. Therefore, admins who want to enable Conditional Access or deploy company apps must update the DEP enrollment profile. This requirement only applies if the DEP enrollment is authenticated with Setup Assistant. In that case, you must push the Company Portal onto the device. To do so, choose **Intune** > **Device enrollment** > **Apple enrollment** > **Enrollment program tokens** > choose a token > **Profiles** > choose a profile > **Properties** > set **Install Company Portal** to **Yes**.

To install the Company Portal on already-enrolled DEP devices, you will need to go to Intune > Client apps, and push it as a managed app with app configuration policies. 

#### Configure how end users update a line-of-business (LOB) app using an app protection policy<!-- 3568384 -->
You can now configure where your end users can get an updated version of a line-of-business (LOB) app. End users will see this feature in the **min app version** conditional launch dialog, which will prompt end users to update to a minimum version of the LOB app. You must provide these update details as part of your LOB app protection policy (APP). This feature is available on iOS and Android. On iOS, this feature requires the app to be integrated (or wrapped using the wrapping tool) with the Intune SDK for iOS v. 10.0.7 or above. On Android, this feature would require the latest Company Portal. To configure how an end user updates a LOB app, the app needs a managed app configuration policy sent to it with the key, `com.microsoft.intune.myappstore`. The value sent will define which store the end user will download the app from. If the app is deployed via the Company Portal, the value must be `CompanyPortal`. For any other store, you must enter a complete URL.

#### Intune management extension PowerShell scripts<!-- 3734186  -->
You can configure PowerShell scripts to run with the user’s admin privileges on the device. For more information, see [Use PowerShell scripts on Windows 10 devices in Intune](../apps/intune-management-extension.md) and [Win32 app management](../apps/app-management.md).

#### Android Enterprise app management<!-- 4459905 -->
To make it easier for IT admins to configure and use Android Enterprise management, Intune will automatically add four common Android Enterprise related apps to the Intune admin console. The four Android Enterprise apps are the following apps:

- **[Microsoft Intune](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.intune)** - Used for Android Enterprise fully managed scenarios.
- **[Microsoft Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator)** - Helps you sign in to your accounts if you use two-factor verification.
- **[Intune Company Portal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal)** - Used for App Protection Policies (APP) and Android Enterprise work profile scenarios.
- [Managed Home Screen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.launcher.enterprise) - Used for Android Enterprise dedicated/kiosk scenarios.

Previously, IT admins would need to manually find and approve these apps in the [Managed Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps) as part of setup. This change removes those previously manual steps to make it easier and faster for customers to use Android Enterprise management.

Admins will see these four apps automatically added to their Intune apps list at the time that they first connect their Intune tenant to managed Google Play. For more information, see [Connect your Intune account to your Managed Google Play account](../enrollment/connect-intune-android-enterprise.md). For tenants that have already connected their tenant or who already use Android Enterprise, there is nothing admins need to do. Those four apps will automatically show up within 7 days of the completion of the May 2019 service rollout.
